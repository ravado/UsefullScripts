## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Secrets and credentials are stored in a separate `.env` file placed next to the script  
(for example, `backup.env` for `2_restore_samba.sh`):

```ini
USERNAME="your_samba_username"
PASSWORD="your_samba_password"
SMB_CRED_USER="your_client_user"
SMB_CRED_PASS="your_client_pass"
...
```


## üèÉ One-Liner Installer & Runner

To download all scripts, ensure environment loading is set up, and run each script interactively with confirmation:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravado/UsefullScripts/main/PhotoFrame/migration/install_all.sh)
```

## üìå Prefixes and Backup Names

**Use a prefix** to distinguish between multiple PicFrame devices:
```bash
./0_backup_setup.sh home
./0_backup_setup.sh batanovs
```

**Restore by prefix**:
```bash
./3_restore.sh home latest
./3_restore.sh batanovs latest
```

**Restore by exact filename**:
```bash
./3_restore.sh home picframe_home_setup_backup_20250802_104025.tar.gz
```
